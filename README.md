## Overview
In this project, the goal is to leverage data analysis to recommend the best country for launching a railway travel booking startup. As a newly hired data analyst, you have access to a dataset encompassing various country-specific metrics such as GDP, railway infrastructure details, ease of doing business score, and more. The analysis involves evaluating these factors to determine the most promising market for the new business. Key considerations include prioritizing a high GDP versus a favorable business environment, assessing the impact of existing railway infrastructure and usage, and understanding the significance of international visitors.
